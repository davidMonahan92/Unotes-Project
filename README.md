# Unotes-Project
The Unotes web application was my DCU final year project. It is an interactive Learning Development app aimed at 
students over the age of 60. 

The app was designed in such a way that all user groups, especially the over 60's students, would be 
able to easily access their school or course materials and enjoy a pleasurable user experience while doing so. 

Once the user has logged in or signed up, they are given four different options to view their notes or assignments, by PDF, Video, 
Audio or Slideshow. Using custom stylesheets, bootstrap, specific colour schemes and design styles, I successfully catered 
to the easy and pleasurable user experience.
