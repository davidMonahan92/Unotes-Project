						<!-- Question Answer -->
						<div class="panel-body">
							Unotes is aimed at the older generation of student (Over the age of 60). As students over the age of 60 might not have the same skill and abilities to use technologies as someone in their twenties, the aim is to design and make this application as simple as possible to navigate and appealing to older students making it very accessible. I also want to make this app as accessible as possible including students with disabilities and other diverse user groups. With simple, fluent features this app will allow anyone of any skill type and range to use it.
